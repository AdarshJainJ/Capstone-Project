# Capstone Project: Analyzing and Modeling US Accident Data

Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to analyze a large dataset of US traffic accidents to uncover patterns, predict accident-prone areas, and provide actionable insights that enhance road safety measures and aid stakeholders in decision-making.

Key Technical Methods:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   1. Data cleaning: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized data formats.
   2. Feature engineering: Created derived features such as accident severity levels and time-of-day categorizations.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   1. Analyzed accident trends across states, times, and weather conditions using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
   2. Uncovered correlations between accident severity and factors such as weather, road conditions, and lighting.

3. Statistical Analysis:
   1. Performed hypothesis testing to identify statistically significant relationships between features.
   2. Applied measures like Z-tests, T-tests, and ANOVA for insights.

4. Machine Learning Models:
   1. Built classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) to predict accident severity.
   2. Evaluated model performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

5. Geospatial Analysis:
   1. Visualized accident-prone areas using heatmaps and geographic plots with Folium and GeoPandas.

Outcomes:

1. Identified high-risk areas and time periods for accidents, enabling targeted safety measures.
2. Successfully predicted accident severity with optimized classification models, contributing to proactive resource allocation.
3. Provided insights into the role of environmental factors, leading to data-driven safety recommendations.

Key Achievement: XGBoost model achieved a 73% recall score, demonstrating strong performance in identifying severe accidents.
