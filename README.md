# Capstone-Project

US Accidents Severity Prediction : Utilized various classification models (logistic regression,
ensemble techniques) to predict accident severity.Applied hyperparameter tuning with Hyperopt
to fine-tune model performance and improve accuracy.

Key Achievement: XGBoost model achieved a 73% recall score, demonstrating strong
performance in identifying severe accidents.

Tools & Technologies: Python (scikit-learn, XGBoost), Hyperopt, Classification Models,
Recall (performanceÂ metric)
